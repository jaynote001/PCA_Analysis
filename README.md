# PCA_Keras
## Analysis Targets
Apply Dimensional Reduction on a simple Digits base Image Dataset and check effects of Dimensional Reduction on Accuracy when we train it using simple Perceptron Model.

## Analysis Steps
#### 1) Important Machine Learning Packages required for analysis.
#### 2) Apply Data Preprocessing on Training Set and Test Set.
#### 3) Reshape the First Character and print it.
#### 4) Apply Standardization to all Data.
#### 5) Plot Variance vs Number of Dimensions to find out what is optimal Number of Components.
#### 6) Apply PCA with Dimensional Reduction with outcome value set to 100.
#### 7) Invert PCA Decomposition
#### 8) Plot Original Images and Decompose Images Side by Side to have a good feel of comparison.
#### 9) Train Model using Simple Perceptron and Fit in the Training Data.
#### 10) Analyze the Predicitions.
